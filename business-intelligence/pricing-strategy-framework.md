## Value-Based Pricing Models

### 🎯 ROI-Driven Pricing

#### 💪 **Scale Automation** - $5k-15k/month  
- **Target**: Mid-size businesses, 50-200 employees
- **Services**: Multiple workflow automation, advanced AI agents

## Competitive Intelligence

### Market Research Priorities

### Value Differentiators

- **ROI Focus**: Guarantee measurable savings
- **24/7 Support**: Always-available business co-pilot

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Strategy
1. **Present highest tier first** - Makes mid-tier seem reasonable
2. **Bundle services** - Harder to comparison shop
3. **Focus on savings** - "This pays for itself in 2 weeks"
4. **Time urgency** - "Your competitors are already automating"

### Objection Handling
- **"Too expensive"** → Focus on ROI, not cost
- **"We'll do it ourselves"** → Highlight speed to market
- **"Not ready yet"** → Emphasize competitive disadvantage

## Implementation Notes

### Initial Pricing Strategy
- Start at premium end of market (high-value positioning)
- Offer "pilot project" at 50% to establish case studies
- Increase prices 20% every 6 months as demand grows

### Revenue Optimization
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) model
- 6-month minimum contracts
- 20% upfront payment
