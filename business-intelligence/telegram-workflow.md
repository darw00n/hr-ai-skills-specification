# Telegram Integration - Business Communication Setup

## 🚀 How Telegram + OpenClaw Works

### Your Workflow with Telegram
1. **Chat with me on Telegram** - Send requests, check progress, get updates
2. **I work in the background** - Access files, run code, research, build
3. **I report back to Telegram** - Progress updates, findings, completed work
4. **You review PRs on GitHub** - I create pull requests for your review
5. **You test and approve** - Full control over what goes live

### What You CAN Do from Telegram
- ✅ Give me tasks and projects
- ✅ Get progress reports and updates  
- ✅ Review research findings and data
- ✅ Approve/reject my recommendations
- ✅ Get screenshots of work in progress
- ✅ Receive files and documents I create

### What You REVIEW on Your Computer
- 🔍 Code changes (via PRs)
- 🔍 Full applications and websites
- 🔍 Complex data analysis results
- 🔍 Final testing before deployment
